# Age Calculator

##  Project Description
Age Calculator is a simple web application that calculates a person’s age based on their date of birth.  
It shows the age in **years, months, and days** using JavaScript date logic.

This project helped me understand how to work with dates, user input, and basic JavaScript logic.
